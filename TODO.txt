Step 1
-create a database of all comic strips along with their alt text. Get them all displaying in the app. Use firebase.
-get the blog posts in that database (TBD whether/when these should check for new content). Display blog posts in app from the database.
-Deploy using firebase. (Actual MVP status!)

Step 2
-style individual blogs to match their Blogger styles
-implement "next/prev date with content" functionality.
-get all links in header/footer working.

Step 3
-Modern site theme + toggle to switch between classic/modern mode
-Modern theme: date picker with colored indicators for content (blog/strip)
